				<h2><i>I'm Lebohang Litsoane</i></h2>
				<p>
					I am a very short girl and they call me <b>Litompo</b> and i attend school at St Michael's high school in the form E class. Living in a small village Phukalla, i so enjoy living there because its refreshing everyday when i wake up i get to breath the fresh air from the river just five minutes walk from where i stay.I'm a very friendly person and kind at the same time,my dream is the help people especially old and orphans. I love travelling around the world to learn new things,new culture,new tradition and everything that is lacking in my country.
