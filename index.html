                    This world could be a better place for all if not for teenage pregnacy and early marriage.It has come to our realisation that most girls engage in sexual intercourse at an early age, so what causes that and how do we prevent that?

    	  <p>
    	  		The biggest problem we are facing in our country is poverty,so in most cases people who are powerful tent to take advantage of young girls who are poor by promising to care of them together with their families in return of <b>unprotected sex</b>.The fact here is that it is not about men showing support to such young girls but just a matter of wanting to use them in order to satisfy their male ego,and them leave them later when they discover that they are pregnant.Can you imagine at a young age finding yourself in a compromising situation and having no one to talk to,you feel unwanted,unsave and useless.That is when one would think of aborting her unborn baby or even worse,to commit suicide because of being depressed,so that is unecessary we as girls should learn not to be temptered regardless of our situation rather take the first step towards changing for the better.

                    Going to school without eating is not healthy for a human being and it hard to live knowing that you must sweet blood in order to put bread on the table, that can also cause non improvement in the school work of a student so those such student end up sleeping with rich boys or old fathers all in the name of putting bread on the table.

                        A girl can start fist by liking the pregnancy but the question is how long will the happiness take.

                     Above all guys,we should believe in ourselves,don't let our peers to tell us what to do or rather wish to be like them,<b>peerpressure</b> is very serious in teenage girls who are on a journey of discovering themselves.Frankly they don't know what they are doing,they should also know that they are unique in thier own way,so they should never think of being like someone else but know themselves first on work towards their goals in that way our world could be a better place for all.

                        <p>
                            A girl then tell her friends hoping to get support but they laugh.

                        All the above points can also lead to early marriage in such a way that once a young girl finds someone who provides for her and for the family he will in no time demand for unprotected sex and once she is pregnant will bw forced to marry the father so that the child can be born and raised by both parents in a warm family.Having said all this,it is not good for a child to engage into marriage affairs because marriage is not a child's play.

                <div class="col-md-8">
                   <p>
                        Then the worst part of all this is when the person whom the girl thought would support and rejoice with does not approve the pregnancy.

                                 First of all,<b>abstainance</b>there is no safer contaceptive method than abstainance,or rather teenagers must have campaigns where they could be taught about other ways of protecting themselves,for example, <b>Thakaneng</b> youth girls meet there in order to be taught on how to take care of themselves,so if we could have more of societies like Thakaneng then we will be able to ovecome the obstacle in our way to a bright future.
